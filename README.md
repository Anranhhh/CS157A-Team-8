# CS157A-Team-8

## Project Description
Our project is named “Dishbase”. It is a dynamic, user-centered recipe website designed as a database application to help people answer one of the most common and frustrating daily questions: “What should I eat today?” In today’s fast-paced world, many people lack the time, knowledge, or resources to plan balanced, satisfying meals. According to the World Health Organization, over 3 billion people—more than 42% of the global population—cannot afford a healthy diet, and many more are simply unsure how to combine ingredients into nutritious, delicious meals that match their lifestyle. We believe that food isn't just a necessity—it is deeply tied to culture, well-being, and personal satisfaction. Our project leverages database management systems to create a rich platform where users can find recipe recommendations based on their available ingredients, nutritional goals, and cultural interests.
